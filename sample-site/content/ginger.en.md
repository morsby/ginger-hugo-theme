# GINGER

Explanations in English of how to recognize a Ginger is found in many
places, also in pages to which I provide a link. So there is little need
to repeat it all here. Let me just quickly give you the important dates:

**1954** - The first dolls were marketed, walkers with painted lashes.

**1955** - The dolls now had molded lashes. First came the small-eyed
version, presumably later the same year the medium-eyed and the
large-eyed version, too.

**1956** - The dolls now had bending knees. Some also had bending
elbows, but so far I have seen none that seem 'genuine', so they may all
have been clones. The same year brought the vinyl-headed dolls (still
with hard plastic body). The earliest ones had rather unfortunate eyes,
that tend to sink into their sockets or go awry, making the doll look
cross-eyed. Some had painted eyelashes in the outer corner of their eye,
others didn't. Cosmopolitan worked a way out of the sunken-eyes-problem,
and some of these later dolls are really pretty.

What information I have not really seen elsewhere concerns the wig
styles.

There seems to be some doubt as to whether the very earliest Ginger
dolls had a full cap wig or just the backing strip like all the clone
dolls. If they had a full cap, it would mean that hardly any 'genuine'
old PL Ginger dolls are found today, only clones. This would seem a bit
odd, so I suppose they started off with Dynel stitched onto a backing
strip and glued down, thereby being indistinguishable from the clones.
But I have an [old PL doll](ginger7) with a Saran wig with full cap;
this wig is a bit the worse for wear and probably is original, so it
would seem that Cosmopolitan switched to the Saran wigs while the dolls
were still the PL type.

The wigs came in two styles: [Roll/flip](images/panflip.jpg) and
[braids](images/panbraids.jpg) (please note the picture on the right
shows a wig that is NOT Ginger's - just to show how characteristic
Ginger's braids are). The old catalogs list three colours: Platinum
blonde, honey blonde and [brunette](images/1211_1958&1959NK_2.jpg). I
have seen no platinum blonde, but I did see [very light blondes and darker blondes apart from the in-between honey blondes](images/panblondewig.jpg).

There was also two rooted hair styles: A [short bob](images/1253_1958NK%20(2).jpg) and a
[ponytail](images/panponytail.jpg) high on the head. Again the colours
are said to be [platinum blonde](images/554&555_1957US_2b.jpg), honey
blonde and [brunette](images/panbrunetterooted.jpg). And again I have
seen [more blonde shades than the honey blonde](images/panblonderooted.jpg) - apart from the true platinum
blonde.

Ginger is said to have come with pastel coloured hair as well. The
[wigged ones](images/panothercolorswig.jpg) I have seen all seem to be
clones, but I do have two
[vinyl-headed](images/panothercolorsrooted.jpg) ones, one with green,
the other with blue hair, the third one with a light green ponytail I no
longer own. I never yet saw the one with pink hair.

It is also said that there was a Ginger with dark skin. [My own doll](images/blackginger_small.jpg) and all others I have so far seen
are, however, clones. Their hair is extremely wiry, their eyes are not
very well made, and they are strung, not walkers.

The larger picture shows the five major Ginger types I own - the narrow
ones a Pam/Ginger Cha-Cha Heel doll.
