# The Ginger dolls and me

I have been crazy about dolls most of my life, my childhood dolls were many: composite, rubber, celluloid, hard plastic and vinyl dolls. In the 1950'es and 1960'es, dolls were often still a domestic produce, so mine were mostly Danish dolls, but I also had the small English Rosebud Thumb Suck baby and the similar German small Schildkröt baby, one pale, the other dark, a French Bella doll and a large fashion doll also of foreign, now forgotten origin (but no Barbie). And then I had a couple of - for a Danish girl - unusual dolls: two Ginger dolls!

My father travelled a lot in those days, and he brought me these dolls from Sweden. In all Scandinavia they were only to be found in a single Swedish department store. They were not baby dolls, they had real wigs, their clothes were so beautiful, and all sorts of accessories were available, including furniture painted white with pink flowers and the name Ginger. I even had glasses for them - some consolation for a small girl having to wear glasses herself! At the time I thought these dolls were Swedish, but I became wiser later.

I grew up, most of my toys were given away, but after about 30 years one Ginger returned to me! In a pitiful state, but still charming. Her hair had almost completely gone, there was hardly any facial colour left, and she had neither clothes nor shoes. I was hooked once again and decided to restore her to her former beauty. I managed to make her a new wig from an old hair pad I had inherited, she borrowed some clothes from the old Schildkröt baby doll that I somehow still was in possession of, but the shoes were too small for her. Then I remembered hearing about eBay and figured I might find something there. I certainly did! Not only shoes, but clothes in abundance, and more dolls!

And this is my childhood Ginger, to the right.
