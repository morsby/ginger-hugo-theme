# Intro

This is meant as a just-for-fun site to show off my small (mainly) American dolls of the fifties: Ginger, Little Miss Ginger and Miss Ginger from Cosmopolitan, Ginny and Jill from Vogue - and all the rest of them (including similar English dolls).

Another purpose is to make these dolls better known here in Denmark where they - to my knowledge - were never found in the shops, being accordingly more or less unknown. For this reason, some pages will be available in Danish only as all the info is available elsewhere to English-speaking visitors (I have many links on my [LINKS](/links) page).

I posted pictures and descriptions of most of my dolls. I also started on the outfits. The pages will not be static; I may change a description, post a new doll, take another doll off alltogether - so come back later to see what might have changed.

- Many changes will be mentioned on my [NEWS](/news) page, so it's a good idea to check this page often.
- You get an enlarged view of most pictures by clicking on them. A second click may bring you a further enlargement.
- Please use the menu on the left side of the page to navigate around.
- If you have any questions or even better: interesting pieces of information for me, please don't hesitate to contact me: [Webmaster](mailto:webmaster@gingerdolls.dk).
- I made a page with dolls that I intend to sell (now and then I may also post some clothes). When I'm in the mood to do so, I'll list them on tradera.com, qxl.dk and similar auction sites.
- The true bonus is that it all also helps me keep track of my dolls, as their number seems to be growing all the time.
