# ginger-hugo-theme

A Hugo theme with TailwindCSS JIT.

## Usage:

- Development: `npm run dev` (also runs `hugo serve` from the sample site)
- Build: `npm run build`

Both commands will output a CSS file to `assets/css/dist/main.css`, which is then imported into Hugo.

In `sample-site/`, a test Hugo site is located, using this theme.
